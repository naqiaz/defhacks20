This application was created by Taher Calcuttawala, Qasim Ali, and Naqia Zaveri for the DefHacks20 Hackathon. The application utilizes the NLTK to apply word scores
to restaurant reviews.

The purpose of this application is to determine whether overall sentiment for a restaurant is positive or negative.
